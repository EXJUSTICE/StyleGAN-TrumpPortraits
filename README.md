# StyleGAN-TrumpPortraits
ThisPresidentDoesNotExist: StyleGAN generation using Tensorflow.

Based upon the work of Karras at the NVIDIA team  & AK9250's stylegan-art repositories,
We've used styleGAN's to generate artistic representations of the 45th president using a Kaggle dataset through transfer learning.

Originally run on GoogleColabs for 1 tick (approx. 6 hours). Improvements in realism could be attained with further training.
